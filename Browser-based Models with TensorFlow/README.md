Course 1 - Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js â€“ Examples and Exercises
===========================================================================

This repository contains the examples and exercises that accompany Course 1 - Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js of the TensorFlow for Data and Deployment Specialization at Coursera. 

# Setting Up

You will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine to run the examples and exercises. We recommend you use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as your internet browser,  [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) as your HTML editor and the [Web Server for Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) as your web server. All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. 

The exercise and example in Week 3 of this course also contains a Jupyter Notebook. To run this notebook you will need have installed Jupyter with Python 3, TensorFlow 2.0, Tensorflowjs, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  


Have fun learning TensorFlow.js!
